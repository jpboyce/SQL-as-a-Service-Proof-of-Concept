# SQLaaSPoC
Scripts and other files relating to a "SQL as a Service" Proof of Concept I made with VMware's vRealize Automation product, as detailed in an [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sql-service-proof-concept-2012-vrealize-automation-jesse-boyce) on Linkedin I wrote in 2016.  Where possible I've tried to sanitise the content.  Given that this was a POC, the code is neither pretty nor does it have any real input validation or error handling.
